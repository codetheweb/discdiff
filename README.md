# discdiff

This is a very quick and dirty website diff implimentation that notifies you about changes via Discord. It does not support:

- Changing the command prefix from `,`
- Sites that require JS to fully render
- Including any details about the computed diff in the notification
- Using roles for authentication (only server owner can control it)
